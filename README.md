# Big Data Basics

*by [BigBoards](http://bigboards.io)*

In this **2-day workshop** you will learn how to build a complete **data processing pipeline**. The workshop is **hands-on** using a [BigBoards Hex](http://bigboards.io/orderprototype). You will be touching **several common Big Data technologies**.

The accompanying [repository](https://github.com/bigboards/bb-stack-training), contains all the technologies, resources and solutions to complete the workshop.

During this workshop, you will

- **ingest** data from a rather large **relational database** that contains weather and sales data;
- **store** the raw data on **distributed file system** as your primary data;
- **restructure**&nbsp;the data for **easier analysis**;
- and finally apply **machine learning** to build a **recommendation engine**.

## Big Data technologies

We have packaged all the required technologies for this workshop as a [BigBoards Tint](http://hive.bigboards.io/#/library/stack/google-oauth2-103728492012393057640/bb-stack-training). With the click of a button you can install everything on a Hex, in the cloud or on your own servers. Just head over to the [BigBoards Hive](http://hive.bigboards.io).

The technologies which you will be using for your end-to-end data pipeline, are:

- [Apache Hadoop](https://hadoop.apache.org/) for distributed storage, processing and resource management, 
- [Apache Sqoop](http://sqoop.apache.org/) for ingestion of relational data, 
- [Apache Pig](https://pig.apache.org/) to write data transformations, 
- [Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org/) for lightning fast data processing, 
- [Apache Spark SQL](http://spark.apache.org/sql/) for uniform data access, 
- [Apache Spark MLlib](http://spark.apache.org/mllib/) for machine learning. 

For now, we still host the data external to the big data clusters.

## Presentations 
You will learn the basics on Big Data and cluster processing using 2 presentations:

1. [Big Data Basics - Common](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1RqklSUIA1X6kW5UCPzgBAagf8YEV5eQhKB665Sx98_8/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000) explains Big Data and it use cases.
2. [Big Data Basics - Building a Data Pipeline](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LZadkLa4bnPerLE9ckaKR4ibrQxw5PiApnHeB2I27fQ/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000) guides you through the practical exercises. This presentation covers all the technologies and the resources for this project.

The [BigBoards Hex](http://bigboards.io/orderprototype) gives you everything you need to get your hands dirty.

## Practical
