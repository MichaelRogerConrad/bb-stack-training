# Big Data Basics
This repository contains all the technologies and resources needed for a **2 day Big Data introductory workshop** by [BigBoards](http://bigboards.io/). 

## Goal
In a **2-day hands-on workshop** using our [BigBoards Hex](http://bigboards.io/orderprototype), you learn how to build an **end-to-end data processing pipeline** using several **common big data technologies**. 

We will

* **ingest** data from a fairly large **relational database** containing weather and retail data; 
* **store** the raw data on a **distributed file system** as your primary data;
* **restructure** the data for easier analysis;
* And finally apply some **machine learning** algorithms to build a simple **recommendation engine**;


## Big Data technologies
All the required technologies are packaged as a [BigBoards Tint](http://hive.bigboards.io/#/library/stack/google-oauth2-103728492012393057640/bb-stack-training) so you can install everything with the click of a button through the [BigBoards Hive](http://hive.bigboards.io). 

We packaged the following technologies to build an **end-to-end data processing pipeline**: 

* [Apache Hadoop](https://hadoop.apache.org/) for distributed storage, processing and resource management;
* [Apache Sqoop](http://sqoop.apache.org/) for ingestion of relational data; and finally
* [Apache Pig](https://pig.apache.org/) to easily write data transformations;
* [Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org/) for lightning fast data processing;
* [Apache Spark SQL](http://spark.apache.org/sql/) for uniform data access;
* [Apache Spark MLlib](http://spark.apache.org/mllib/) for machine learning.

The data is hosted on a server **external to the big data clusters** for now.

 
## Presentations
During 2 presentations, you learn the basics on Big Data and cluster processing:

* [BigData Basics - Commons](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1RqklSUIA1X6kW5UCPzgBAagf8YEV5eQhKB665Sx98_8) 
gives an overview of what big data is and what it is being used for;
* [BigData Basics - Building a Data Pipeline](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1LZadkLa4bnPerLE9ckaKR4ibrQxw5PiApnHeB2I27fQ) 
will guide you while building your own data pipeline. It covers all the technologies and the resources required for this project. 

The **BigBoards Hex** provides you with everything you need to get your hands dirty.
